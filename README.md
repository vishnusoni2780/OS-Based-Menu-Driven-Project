# python_codes

Hello guys, 
this an OS based menu driven python program which is a part of IIEC RISE Community under training of Specialization in Python.
---
IMP: You have to set path of all applcations to your environment variable then you only these all will run perfectly.
---
Objective:-
	user will command the system to run/start any application and the python program run that prompted application behalf of OS.

Code/Output:-
	in this code, i've written some 18 application code which this program can execute. For the proper execution, i've set enviroment variables in path to my system.
using two modules, pyttsx3 & os , this program execution is done in very nice formating.
	First of all there is a welcome text to "IIEC RISE COMMUNITY" and then a simple intro with welcome to my this pythom program on text as well as audio also.
After this an audion will generate which will ask you about requirement and a text will apear with repl at the beginning of it. Terminal will keep prompting to you.
Now, user have to command the system. (ex.- "hey, run vlc media player for me.") so the program will execute the given task. but after execution it will again prompt to enter any other requirement.
so to stop this you have to type one of these words ('stop','done','out','quit','exit'). (ex.- "okay stop it now.") Then the program will stop prompting and get out from execution.
‚óè If you say "Thank You" or "Thanks" to the programe , it will accept it and will speak to you in return and ask politely again if you want to do something else there or not.
This time you have to command it in Yes or No format ('Y','y','N','n').
- if you enter "Y" or 'y', it will again ask you for requirement which you want to execute.
- if you enter "N" or 'n', it will breal the process and comes out from the execution.
-if you enter any thing else , it will speak to you that it has assumed that you want something else more and prompt the requirement to you.
When you quit this , it will speak up to you with a greeting message and say thank you for using it.
